File Organization
The project includes one HTML file and two CSS files.
The HTML file provides the structure, and each CSS file creates a different visual layout.
Keeping the files separate makes the project organized and easy to understand.

Challenges They Faced
A challenge was ensuring that the two CSS files stayed independent without conflicting styles.
Another challenge was organizing the structure clearly so each design version could be tested easily.
